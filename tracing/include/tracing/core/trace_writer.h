// This is a single-thread write interface that allows to write protobufs
// directly into the tracing shared buffer without making any copies.
// It takes care of acquiring and releasing chunks from the
// ProducerSharedMemoryArbiter and splitting protos over chunks.
// The idea is that each data source creates one TraceWriter for each thread
// it wants to write from. Each TraceWriter will get its own dedicated chunk
// and will write into the shared buffer without any locking most of the time.
// Locking will happen only when a chunk is exhausted and a new one is acquired
// from the arbiter.

// TODO: TraceWriter needs to keep the shared memory buffer alive (refcount?).
// If the shared memory buffer goes away (e.g. the Service crashes) the
// TraceWriter here will happily keep writing into unmapped memory.
